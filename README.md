# Gareth's Tidy Tuesday Efforts

This is a repository to store and showcase my own [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) efforts.

# Effort 1 - Space Races

This week, the data was a summary of every rocket launch since humans started firing things into space. There was a whole heap of interesting metadata, including things like the agency responsible and the names of the rockets used - which might have lent itself to analysis of famous series of rocket launches like Saturn or Apollo - but I kept things simple with an analysis of launches by country:

# Effort 2 - Got Milk?

This week was a chance to get my map on. I stuck with what I know and mapped using `ggplot2`, but I've been meaning to use newer packages such as `sf` and `cartography`, so will aim to use these next time.

# Effort 3 - PhDs

My most recent [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tidytuesday?lang=en) concerned the subjects in which PhDs were awarded in the US since 2007. I was interested which subjects had increased or decreased in popularity in their own right, and was happy to see that the popularity of Mathematics/Statistics was on the up.
